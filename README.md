UrjaMitra is a smart app designed to reduce electricity wastage in hostels by monitoring and analyzing room-wise power consumption.

 What data we track (dataset columns):

Room_no → identifies each hostel room.

Month / Day / Hour → tells us when electricity is being used (time patterns).

Consumption (kWh) → actual electricity used by the room.

Average Consumption (kWh) → the expected normal usage benchmark.

Wastage (kWh) → extra electricity used beyond the average (our target output).



Impact on society:

Reduces unnecessary electricity consumption.

Promotes awareness and responsible usage among young students.

Supports sustainability and lowers the carbon footprint in educational campuses.
